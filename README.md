This is my personal github page. I worked with Professor Jun Yan to get my senior honors thesis published.  We employed a generalized linear mixed model and a signed-rank test for clustered data to track and field reaction times to investigate the 2022 World Track and Field Championships.  The thesis was written in LaTeX and the analysis was performed using R.

This past summer I interned at Unilver in Trumbull, CT as part of their R & D summer intern program.  While there, I analyzed large datsets using python libraries such as `numpy`, `pandas`, `scipy`, and `scikit-learn`.  Based on my results, I was then able to make recommendations to Unilever's directors on how to better judge the stability of their products.
